# Gacha Showcase built on Unity

In this project, there will be several ways to handle a variable system.

.
     Weighted Loot System 
===============================
The first one I've added is the Weighted Loot System, can be found and demo'd on the WeightGacha Scene in \Scenes!
Each category will have a weighted percentage totalling up to 100%. Similar to gacha games now, everything is weighted and in each category will have it's own seperate pool of rewards the random-number-generator gives you.

I will add more description later and as well as my sources... for now I sleep.
